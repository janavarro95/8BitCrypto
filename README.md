# Python Summer Camp Cryptography
A cryptography resource written in Python that was created to facilitate the learning for iD tech summer camps. The included resources for the week long camp include.

1. An example on how to write simple Python classes. [Link](https://github.com/janavarro95/8BitCrypto/tree/master/Class%20Example)
2. A fake virus program that creates a lot of .txt files that have the hidden phrase "I am the virus". It is then the student's job to create a program that reads all the contents of these files, decode them using certain Ciphers such as the Ceaser Cipher, and report back what .txt file has the secret phrase.

3. A program that encrypts secret messages into an image by modifying the alpha values of pixels on the image. [Link](https://github.com/janavarro95/8BitCrypto/tree/master/ImageProgram)
4. A few secret messages that were encrypted using a program that used a combination of Ceasear Ciphers and Hex Editing to hid secret messages.
